#### Challenge 7: Module 7

# Overview of the Project

## Purpose of Pewlett Hackard Analysis

The first part of Module 7 consisted in the creation of an ERD for data visualization. The ERD shows 6 tables representing each csv file with their respective column names and the type of value located in it. It also shows the connections between each file using primary keys. The ERD was a useful tool for the challenge, it was necessary to review those tables before writing the code to see specific connections.
After the review of the ERD, the main purpose of the challenge was to create a database analysis to see the retirement employees with their most recent job title. Selected employees must borned between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, and they need to be currently working in the company. A mentorship-eligibility table was also created with employees borned in 1965, to visualize possible mentors for the program.
The intention of the Pewlett Hackard analysis is to obtain specific information of the future retirement employers from each department to be able to prepare the hire stage and their training with some mentors.
